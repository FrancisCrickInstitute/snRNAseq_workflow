ERROR ~ Unable to acquire lock on session with ID 12c975ed-9292-4d4b-a241-6d6cd1cf87cd

Common reasons for this error are:
 - You are trying to resume the execution of an already running pipeline
 - A previous execution was abruptly interrupted, leaving the session open

You can see which process is holding the lock file by using the following command:
 - lsof /rds/general/user/art4017/home/snRNAseq_workflow/.nextflow/cache/12c975ed-9292-4d4b-a241-6d6cd1cf87cd/db/LOCK

 -- Check '.nextflow.log' file for details
